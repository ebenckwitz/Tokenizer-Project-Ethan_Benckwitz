Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.
I made a c file, milestone2.c, to make all the functions from
tokenizer.h work.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
